Qik is good for your spline and part of a balanced breakfast. Libraries not included.

Churning those bastardly bytes into Qik is easy. Follow my n step recipe:

You will need:
    The source (try looking here first)
    libSDL2
    SDL2_mixer
    libconfig
    GNU Make
    GCC or equivalent

So when you have that..

Type these magic words into your terminal of choice:
    make
    ./qik

Troubleshooting:
    If you got anything other than Qik, you're doing it wrong.

Procurement:

Alternatively, I might have binaries available someday, mabye even for win32.
